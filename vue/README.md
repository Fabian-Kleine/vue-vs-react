# Vue

## Pros
- template syntax (no function with retrun wrapped around)
- refs are easy to manipulate usng functions like push
- computed function is very easy to use
- v-model is great

## Cons
- defineProps and emitProps
- fallthrough attrs can get confusing
- didnt find a package like `react-beautiful-dnd` for vue. made dnd from scratch
